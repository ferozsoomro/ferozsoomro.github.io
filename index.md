I am working as an Instructor of Mathematics at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.vt.edu/), Virginia Polytechnic and State University.

I received M.S. and Ph.D. degree in Mathematics from Department of Mathematics, Nanjing University in 2015 and 2018, respectively. I have been teaching mathematics for over nine years.

My area of research is scientific computing, applied mathematics, and data-driven modeling and computation. I am interested in modeling and simulation of coupled nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations arising from science and engineering. I work on modeling and simulation of heat transfer processes using scientific machine learning methods, particularly Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

_Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in working with me on the above project._

## Research Interests
